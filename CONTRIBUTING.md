# Contributing

All contributions are welcome. When doing so, please follow the rules listed below:

- ## Branch naming

  Please use the following naming convention when creating branches:
  `<type-of-branch>/<feature-name>`

  For example, if you're developing a feature that will allow for fetching mp3 files,
  name it `feat/fetch-mp3-url`.
  Other example prefixes might be:

  - `fix`
  - `chore`
  - `docs`
  - `refactor`
  - `test`

- ## Code Review

  If you submitted a PR, at least two other team members must Approve it before merging into the master branch/

- ## Assigning issues

  If you are going to work on an issue (and eventually submit a PR), formally assign the issue to yourself so that everybody can see you've claimed it.

- ## Addressing issues
  If your PR addresses an issue, reference the issue in the title of the PR.
  If your PR fixes the issue, use `fixes #<issue-number>`.
